Data preprocessing for Sales Units forecasting

Step-1: Clean the data 

Step-2: Split the data set into numerical and categorical variables.

Step-3: Convert Categorical variables to dummy variables,

Step-4: Multiple imputations on both the numerical and categorical variables to fill the missing values. 

Step-5: Data exploration and visualization

Step-6: Feature scaling using min-max normalization, z-score normalization and robust scaler. 

Step-7: Dimensionality reduction methods such as Autoencoder, PCA, Truncated single value decomposition, Gaussian random projection and sparse random projection

Step-8: Train the data with three models such as Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Multilayer Perceptron.

Step-9:  Evaluation of the result using  R-squared and RMSE
