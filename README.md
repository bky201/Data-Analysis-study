Data preprocessing for Sales Units forecasting

Step-1:  Clean the data 

Step-2:  Split the data set into numerical and categorical variables.

Step-3: Categorical variables are converted to dummy variables,

Step-4: multiple imputations were performed on both the numerical and categorical variables to fill the missing values. 

Step-5:  Data exploration and visualization

Step-6:  feature scaling is done using min-max normalization, z-score normalization and robust scaler. 

Step-7: Data is reduced with different dimensionality reduction methods such as Autoencoder, PCA, Truncated single value decomposition, Gaussian random projection and sparse random projection

Step-8: The Data is trained with three models such as Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Multilayer Perceptron.

Step-9:  Evaluation of the result using  R-squared and RMSE
